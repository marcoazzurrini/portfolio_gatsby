      <AboutText>
        After completing my IT diploma, I decided to relocate to London, UK,
        where I stayed for almost 6 years. I worked a variety of jobs, spanning
        from catering, construction to transporation.

        Looking back, those were very formative years, I learned many life
        lessons, including the value of hard work and dedication. Working
        blue-collar jobs allowed me to build my character and give me the
        determination to later succeed as a developer.

        However after a few years I felt like I could do more.

        In March 2018, after a minor car accident while I was working my courier
        job, I decided it was time for a change, it was time to go back to my
        original passion: programming!

        I started waking up at 6am to study HTML, CSS and Javascript before
        going to work. I quickly started loving Javascript, gradually I
        dedicated more and more time to it and in January 2019 I decided to take
        the risk and transition to full time developer.

        During this time, I was awarded by Deliveroo a full scholarship to study
        Front-end Web Development with OpenClassrooms, europeâ€™s largest
        online-only higher education institution. I also took a number of online
        courses, covering all the topics then I need to assert myself in the job
        market.

        Most importantly every single course and lesson that I took, I applied
        it. I built countless projects, some of theme you can see on this
        website. I also solved more than 200 algorithmic challenges on websites
        like codewars.com, hackerrank.com and hackajob.com. I fell in love with
        coding and problem solving.

        I can confidently say that programming is one of the best things that
        has ever happened to me. It has taught me to think critically and gave
        me incredible opportunities.
